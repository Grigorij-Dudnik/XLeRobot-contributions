# Software

Here we will show how to run XLeRobot under the lerobot framework.

### [Install LeRobot ðŸ¤— and Move XLeRobot files](getting_started/install.md)

### Quick Guide

```{note}
If you haven't played with lerobot SO101 Arm before, it's recommended to test single arm setup teleop and play with it for a while first.
```

1. **Choose Control Method**: Joint control (example 0) for basic motor testing, end-effector control for teleop (example 1 & 6)
2. **Advanced Features**: Try dual-arm control (example 2) or vision-based control (example 3) for more complex tasks
3. **Full System**: Use keyboard (example 4), Xbox controller (example 5), or Switch Joycon (example 7) for complete XLeRobot teleop

All example scripts are located in the [`software/examples/`](https://github.com/Vector-Wangel/XLeRobot/tree/main/software/examples) directory and can be run directly after proper setup and calibration. Some examples needs additional calibration to ensure performance.

```{note}
For basic version of XLeRobot, you don't need a RaspberryPi. Just use your laptop and put it in the IKEA cart if you want to use the full system.
```
